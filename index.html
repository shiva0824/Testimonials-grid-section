     <h3 class="first">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h3>
     <p class="second">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <h3 class="fourth">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h3>
        <p class="fifth">“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer
          for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p></div>

      <h3 class="seventh">An overall wonderful and rewarding experience</h3>

     <p class="nine">Patrick Abrams <br> <p class="fine">Verified Graduate</p>  </p>
      <h3 class="ten">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
      learning from their experiences was easy.</h3>
      <p class="eleven">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
      gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
      junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
      an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”  </p> </div>

      <p class="twelve"> Kira Whittle <br><p class="level">Verified Graduate</p> </p>
    <h3 class="thirteen">  Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! </h3>
     <p class="fourteen">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
      professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
      student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
      did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
      project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
      could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
      experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
      100% recommend! ”</p></div>
